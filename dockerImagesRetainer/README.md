# dockerImagesRetainer

Docker recently changed its Terms of Service, adding a clause that allows it to delete users' files if they havenâ€™t been used for six months or more.

To prevent the images from being deleted, the users will have to pull or push them at least once in a period of 6 months. Pulling the images and then deleting the ones not needed from local storage could take years for users with a big volume of images stored.

This script is designed to automatically pull all of the images of a certain Docker Hub user and then deleting the ones which are not present locally before executing the script.

This will cause a renewal of the lifespan of the images and won't affect in any manner your local Docker environment.

**How to use:**

For private repositories, be sure to "docker login" before executing the script as the images won't be available for public pulls.

Locally, I have 2 images of my own repositories:

```
joeltaberne@local:~$ docker images
REPOSITORY                 TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
joeltf99/hostnamed-http2   latest              962d26ba8705        29 hours ago        166MB
joeltf99/hostnamed-http    latest              895f300c1ab8        30 hours ago        166MB
```

Don't be scared of losing these images, they will be restored later as I will show. You can execute the script:

```
joeltaberne@local:~$ bash images_retainer.sh

Welcome to Docker images retainer!
Please enter your Docker Hub profile name:

Hold on, this can take a while...

This process will repeat for every single image and tag of your repos. Once finished, the images that were available locally before will be restored.

When the images are restored, the expiration date of your repositories after this script execution will be shown.

```
Remember using Docker images retainer again before 2021-03-12 in order not to lose your images!
